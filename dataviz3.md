In this assignment, data visualization critique and recreation have been done.
# Data visualization source
The data vsualization is selected from a report named "Houston-Area Freshwater Wetland Loss,1992–2010", written by John S. Jacob. (Available at:https://cdn-ext.agnet.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ERPT-001-more-flooding-fewer-fish-freshwater-wetland-loss-in-the-houston-area-1992-2010-1.pdf).

The data visualization is shown as followed.

This data visualization displays the loss of the natural freshwater wetlands in Houston by each county. As we all known, Houston is suffering from serious flooding over decades, called flooding capital. The flooding is especially serious in Harris County. It is urgent to figure out the reasons and find the effective solutions. Many hints implicate the wetland loss is a main reason of Houston’s frequent flooding. The government, researchers and citizens are all want to get information about this issue. This chart displays the wetland loss of each county, giving people an intuitive impression. The information is valuable for researches on many fields while its design has some problems. Thus, I choose this chart to do the critique and recreating.

From the chart, we can learn that most of losses occurred in Harris, Montgomery, Brazoria and Fort Bend Counties. The greatest losses were in Harris County, where almost 30 percent of the freshwater wetlands have disappeared. It lost 15855 acres of wetlands, almost twice the amount of the other seven counties combined. 

It uses percentage as its y-axis to display how many percent of wetlands have disappeared in each county and displays bars in descending order, showing the wetland loss degree of each county compared with its ordinary wetland area. 
However, it labels the accurate number of acres each county lost on the top of each bar with gleamy border. This actually gives another information but it might make readers confused with its meaning. 
Also, the legend says the total acres lost is 24600 acres, marking with blue square, which is the color of the bar. This will mislead readers to regard the height of the bar as the percentage of total loss of Houston. 
Besides, the chart uses shining labels and chooses 3D model, making it seems a little messy. 

# wireframe and test the solutions
To improve the problems introduced in the former part, I came up with two solutions. One is to seperate the loss as acres and loss as percentage into two chart and put them together sharing one y-axis. The left part uses acres as unit while the right part uses percentage. In this way, readers can check information more conveniently. The other is to draw them in one chart sharing x-axis. Bars represent the loss as acres and lines display loss as percentage. Use same color in bar (line) and legends (labels) to show its category.
