This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
Hi! I am a student in the Telling Stories with Data course. I come from Beijing and major in Civil Environmental Engineering. I love all kinds of animals. I have a cat named Mimi. It is so smart that it is able to turn on the tap and drink water by itself. Besides, it can open the door and even open its favourite cans!  

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to visualize complicated data and present to people in a clear and insteresting way. With the development of the internet, people are exposed to increasingly large data in current era. What people need to do is analyze these data and filter the useful information from the large data pool. After getting the effective information, how to present them and express the idea behind the data become a crucial question. I always find myself couldn't express my core precepitation clearly when I hold a large amount of data. I might make messy powerpoints or draw overcomplicated graghs which are difficult to read. I want to improve my ability of mastering data through this course.
