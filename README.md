# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to visualize complicated data and present to people in a clear and insteresting way. With the development of the internet, people are exposed to increasingly large data in current era. 
Iâ€™m expecting to improve my skills such as data visualization, extracting useful information from data, telling stories and etc. which will always be relevant and will never go out of fashion. Moreover, these skills, especially for telling stories and conveying ideas, are critical for my career goals and many aspects of life. Even though I should and will never stop learning, the skills I developed in this course will, hopefully, help me along my career and life.
