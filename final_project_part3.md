# Final Project Part3

## The idea

### High-level summary: A huge number of animals are killed due to fur industry and actions are needed.
In my final project, I will introduction the information about animals killed due to fur industry through data visualizations of many aspects. According to the story structure in the Good Charts book, I will divide my story into three parts: setup, conflict, and resolution.

**Setup: Fur is considered to be a fashion statement in the world. Many animals are cruelly killed due to fur industry.**

Dataviz1: 19% of women own a fur coat and 7% of men wear fur.

Dataviz2: Each year, around one hundred million animals are bred and killed on intensive fur farms and in the wild.

Dataviz3: Animals are confined in small, barren, wire cages for their entire lives. Unable to express their basic natural behaviors.

**Conflict: There are many anti-fur organizations calling on fur-free activities. However, the fur sales maintain increasing trend and peoples’ attitude didn’t change.**

There are more than 50 anti-fur organizations calling on fur free activities over the world.However, it doesn’t influence much in U.S.

Dataviz4: Mink fur sales in the United States have increased much between 2004 and 2014.

Dataviz5: In the United States, the proportion of people who find fur “morally acceptable” appears to have held relatively constant majority for the past decade according to the findings of the Gallup polls.

**Resolution: Some countries have adopted legislation to limit fur farming, but further measures are needed.**

Dataviz6: Laws are diverse in strength in different countries.

Dataviz7: Among them, many EU Member States have already adopted legislation to prohibit or limit fur farming, but further measures are needed.
